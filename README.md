Data in this report is primarily from the National Incident-Based Reporting System (NIBRS).  The NIBRS contains annual records of reported incidents across the U.S. and is readily available to the public. Each record is especially valuable due to its intricate detailing. For instance, a single incident might encompass multiple offenses.

In this study, our spotlight is on motor vehicle-related offenses, namely motor vehicle theft, theft from a motor vehicle, and theft of motor vehicle parts or accessories. The richness of the NIBRS dataset doesn't just stop at crime numbers; it delves into the specifics of the offenders, the victims, the timing, and the location of the offense.

However, it's crucial to recognize a limitation: the NIBRS captures only reported incidents. As such, there might be unreported occurrences that are not represented in our dataset. With this data in hand, we aim to explore a set of key questions to unearth patterns, trends, and insights related to motor vehicle thefts in Nevada. For the purpose of this analysis, the dataset was cleaned and refined to focus specifically on motor vehicle-related offenses.
